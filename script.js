// I originally encountered issues when trying to access my fun facts from a randomly seleted programming language using dot notation. Below is ChatGPT's explanation of why. I fixed it by using bracket notation.


// ME
// thanks. why does it give an error when I used the dot notation vs the bracket notation to try to access the facts associated with a randomly selected programming language?

// ChatGPT
// The reason you encountered an error when using dot notation (funFacts.progLang) to access the facts associated with a randomly selected programming language is due to how dot notation works in JavaScript.

// Dot notation expects the property name to be a literal identifier (a valid variable name) rather than a variable or an expression. When you use dot notation like funFacts.progLang, JavaScript looks for a property named progLang within the funFacts object, not for the value of the progLang variable.

// In your scenario, progLang holds the name of a programming language stored in a variable, and you want to use this variable's value to dynamically access a property within the funFacts object. For dynamic property access based on a variable, you should use bracket notation.

// So, funFacts[progLang] correctly accesses the property named by the value stored in the progLang variable within the funFacts object, while funFacts.progLang attempts to access a property named exactly "progLang" within the funFacts object, which doesn't exist.
